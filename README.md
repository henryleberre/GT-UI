## How it works

This browser extension executes a content script on every page load that occurs on OSCAR, which once the page loading ends, extracts the page's information and content, before inserting it into our predesigned template for how OSCAR should look. Some extra Javascript & CSS is needed to change the appearance of the page's content (i.e: formating menus, ...).
